## Database Applications Project - Java/SQL Data Analysis

This data analysis program was created as a final project for CS286 - Database Applications to implement SQL Databases with Java code for data analysis.

First, a dataset was selected and database created/prepared to store the data. Each time the program is executed, it accesses the most recent version of the data at the .csv URL provided (by user) and loads this data into SQL. Several queries are executed using the PreparedStatement() Java method to minimize memory usage then output to an Excel or .csv file.

Going forward in development, more features are being considered as well as a version of the project in C++.
